# 🐠 Web Scraping Project — Peces del Mediterráneo

This project scrapes data from the website [**Peces del Mediterráneo**](https://pecesmediterraneo.com/), which provides detailed information about fish species found in the Mediterranean Sea.

The extracted data is used in another personal project — **Snorkelit**, an Android app designed to enhance the snorkeling experience by providing users with easy access to species information.

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **Beautiful Soup** — for parsing and extracting data from HTML.
- **Pandas** — for cleaning, organizing, and managing the scraped data.

## 🚀 Purpose

The goal of this project is to gather structured information about Mediterranean fish species and make it reusable for educational and mobile applications, such as **Snorkelit**.
